**A**uth0 and **R**eac**T**. This repo is for me to learn about how Auth0 and React work together.

To get this to run you need a acount on Auth0.com and create a SinglePageApplication. <br/>
You need to create your own .env file in the root and declare your own REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN and REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID with the information provided to you fron auth0.

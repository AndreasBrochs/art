# ART
**A**uth0 and **R**eac**T**. This repo is a demo on how to secure a React app with Auth0. <br/>
Including Login/Logout, protected links and getting user information from the active user.

To get this to run locally you need a acount on Auth0.com and there create a SinglePageApplication. <br/>
You need to create your own .env file in the root and declare your own REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN and REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID with the information provided to you fron auth0.


Auth0 has a built in context provider that makes authentication in React very easy.
